This is a simple web page, created with html, css and vanilla javascript. 

I have used modern css features like flexboxes, css variables, media-queries to make the page looking nice on small screens, 
also ES6 features, like arrow functions, let and const keywords, destructuring.

I have implemented nice background animation for mobile view top menu, and sliding out menu, also Project Parthers
slider is also animated and smooth switching between Parthers Logos is avaiable.

In FAQ section, all questioins are clickable and dropdown answers are presented.

The web page is completly responsive, so it will look nicely on different size screens, 
thanks to such modern css features like flexboxes, media-queries. 

The project structure is presented below:
Project root folder/
---index.html
---css/styles.css
---js/index.js
---img/images.jpg, png...
---readme.md

To download source code, create a folder for downloading files, and run 'git clone' inside the folder.

After cloning the source code, to run the index.html on localhost, install extension on your IDE, for example 'Go Live' for Visual Studio Code, 
and then open localhost, for example localhost:5500 in your browser. Also you can open the index.html directly with your browser.
