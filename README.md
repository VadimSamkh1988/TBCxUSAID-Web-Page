This is a simple web page, created with html, css and vanilla javascript. 

I have used modern css features like flexboxes, css variables, media-queries to make the page looking nice on small screens, 
also ES6 features, like arrow functions, let and const keywords, destructuring.

To download source code, create a folder for downloading files, and run 'git clone' inside the folder.

After cloning the source code, to run the index.html on localhost, install extension on your IDE, for example 'Go Live' for Visual Studio Code, 
and then open localhost, for example localhost:5500 in your browser. Also you can open the index.html directly with your browser.
